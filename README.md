 Hi there!

 My name is Andrew Toro Gonzalez, a first-generation student at USC studying computer engineering and computer science. 

I plan to become a software engineer in the future and use my education and skills in computer science to help reduce the digital divide in low-income communities.

I have proficiency in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, C/C++, and I am currently learning Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Look at the work that I have done so far!
